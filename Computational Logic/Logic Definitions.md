#### Argument:
> Is a list of sentences, one of which is the conclusion, and the others, if any, are the premises of the argument. 

Imperatives, questions and exclamations are **not sentences**.
#### Consequence
> A sentence $A$ is a **Consequence** of sentences $B_1, \cdots, B_n$ if and only if there is no case where $B_1, \cdots, B_n$ are all true and $A$ is not true. (We also say that $A$ **follows from** $B_1,\cdots,B_n$ or that $B_1,\cdots,B_n$ **entail** $A$.  )

Note that all consequences are conclusions, but not all conclusions are consequences. A consequence is a conclusion that follows from the premises. 
#### Valid Argument:
> An argument is **valid** if and only if the conclusion is a consequence of the premises. 
> 
> Is a [logical argument](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Logical_Argument "Definition:Logical Argument") in which the [premises](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Premise "Definition:Premise") provide conclusive reasons for the [conclusion](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Conclusion "Definition:Conclusion"). It can be either false or true. 

In other words, an argument is **valid** if and only if it is impossible for all of the premises to be true and the conclusion false: _there is no possible universe in which the premises are true and the conclusion false_
#### Invalid Argument:
>An argument is **invalid** if and only if it is not valid, i.e., it has a counterexample. 
>To explain why an argument is invalid, just present a counterexample to prove it.
